# 1.Why must we choose you?

I know that i have a very low experience in programming and I only know c++ language a little bit due to the task i have done and some knowledge from school. 


But I assure you that evenif I dont know how to do a given work I will learn the required things and further learn some more and will come up with a solution since i have a strong desire to study programming.


# 2.How were you before joining and how are you now?


Before trying to join amfoss i learned programming required for the school syllabus and found it as a headache.


Since the Task-2 contained some challenging problems and it could be done in any language I did it in c++.
When i did it i found the fun behind the programming and the possibility in approaching to a particular problem in multiple ways and how to edit a programme to make it more user friendly.


And now am tryng to learn more programming languages like python and learning about linux


# 3.What are your comments and suggestions regarding the selection proce


When I met the mentors i learned that they only direct the students on what all to do and not how to do it.
And I thought the quote of amfoss was **"GOOGLE IT"** so even if i didnt asked any doubt to my mentor I was trying to figure my problem by myself.


But the mentors where good other than the fact about the status update which i found difficult when i didnt do any work that day due to some reasons and i have to say i didnt do anything.


# 4.What is your plan for the next 6 months?


Since i joined CSE batch i have a lot to learn since i am an amature in computer.So the next 6 months i will be exploring different things related to computer programming and engineering and having fun with coding


# 5.How would you to contribute back to the club?


Since i dont know much of the things happening inside amfoss club, but I ensure you whatever the task, I will learn it if i dont know and i will do it in the most efficent way and will be an active member in the club activity.
