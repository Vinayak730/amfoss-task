# 1.Why must we choose you?

I know that i have a very low experience in programming and I only know c++ language a little bit due to the task i have done and some knowledge from school. 


But I assure you that evenif I dont know how to do a given work I will learn the required things and further learn some more and will come up with a solution since i have a strong desire to study programming.


# How were you before joining and how are you now?


Before trying to join amfoss i learned programming required for the school syllabus and found it as a headache.


Since the Task-2 contained some challenging problems and it could be done in any language I did it in c++.


When i did it i found the fun behind the programming and the possibility in approaching to a particular problem in multiple ways and how to edit a programme to make it more user friendly.


And now am tryng to learn more programming languages like python and learning about linux
